Exercise 2.1
Create a constant named myAge and assign it the value of your age.

Exercise 2.2

Exercise 2.3
Declare another daysInYear constant and set it to 365.25 (the number of days in a leap year).

Exercise 2.5
Using the print() function, print the phrases like: "My age is <...> years. In 10 years, I will be <...> years old. From the moment of my birth day have passed <...>" . (Symbols (<...>) must be replaced with variable values !)

Exercise 3.
Calculate triangle's area and perimeter.
Conditions: triangle length: AC = 8.0, CB = 6.0. The hypotenuse of triangle AB is calculated using the sqrt(Double) function, replacing Double with the sum of squares of length.
 Steps:
 1.Right-angled triangle
 2.Hypotenuse of the triangle
 3.Area of a triangle
 4.Triangle perimeter
